### Project Overview :

    This project analyzes vehicle crash data using Apache Spark. The analysis includes identifying accident patterns, 
    vehicle makes involved in crashes, and factors contributing to road accidents.
    The main script (main.py) runs multiple queries using PySpark to extract insights 
    from vehicle crash data. The results are stored in output files.

Customization

Modify config.yaml to change input file paths and input formats.

You can modify VehicleCrashAnalysis.py to add new queries for further analysis.
